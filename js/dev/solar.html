                <h4>A clearer Vue</h4>
                <div>
                    Vue is a modern JavaScript framework that provides useful facilities for progressive enhancement — unlike many other frameworks,
                    you can use Vue to enhance existing HTML. This lets you use Vue as a drop-in replacement for a library like JQuery.
                </div>
                <div>
                    That being said, you can also use Vue to write entire Single Page Applications (SPAs). This allows you to create markup managed
                    entirely by Vue, which can improve developer experience and performance when dealing with complex applications. It also allows you
                    to take advantage of libraries for client-side routing and state management when you need to. Additionally, Vue takes a "middle
                    ground" approach to tooling like client-side routing and state management. While the Vue core team maintains suggested libraries
                    for these functions, they are not directly bundled into Vue. This allows you to select a different routing/state management
                    library if they better fit your application.
                </div>
                <div>
                    In addition to allowing you to progressively integrate Vue into your applications, Vue also provides a progressive approach to
                    writing markup. Like most frameworks, Vue lets you create reusable blocks of markup via components. Most of the time, Vue
                    components are written using a special HTML template syntax. When you need more control than the HTML syntax allows, you can write
                    JSX or plain JavaScript functions to define your components.
                </div>
                <div>
                    As you work through this tutorial, you might want to keep the Vue guide and API documentation open in other tabs, so you can refer
                    to them if you want more information on any sub topic. For a good (but potentially biased) comparison between Vue and many of the
                    other frameworks, see Vue Docs: Comparison with Other Frameworks.
